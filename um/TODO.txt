FINAL TODO:
- Comprehensive tests

- README
    - some instruction tests are naturally done in pairs
        - input/output
        - store/load segment - so some unit tests will use 2 but never more
          than 2 and never any unnecessary untested operations

Unit Tested:
- Conditional Move
- Addition
- Multiplication
- Division
- Bitwise NAND
- Halt
- Output
- Input
- Load Value
- Map Segment
- Unmap Segment
- Segmented Load
- Segmented Store
- Load Program

Instruction Set Test Order:
- Halt
- Load Value / Output
- Input
- Conditional Move
- Addition
- Multiplication
- Division
- Bitwise NAND
- Map Segment
- Unmap Segment
- Store Segment
- Load Segment
- Load Program

Stress Tests:
- Map 0 Segments
- Append Halt instruction by load program
- Each word in a new segment maps to 0
- Correct register values on startup
- Directly edit instructions

- Check segment ids are reused
- Check that after loading a program, the previous segment still exists
